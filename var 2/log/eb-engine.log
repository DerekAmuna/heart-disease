INFO: pip is looking at multiple versions of ggshield to determine which version is compatible with other requirements. This could take a while.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested charset-normalizer==3.4.1
    ggshield 1.35.0 depends on charset-normalizer~=3.1.0

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip to attempt to solve the dependency conflict

INFO: pip is looking at multiple versions of ggshield to determine which version is compatible with other requirements. This could take a while.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested charset-normalizer==3.4.1
    ggshield 1.35.0 depends on charset-normalizer~=3.1.0

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip to attempt to solve the dependency conflict
