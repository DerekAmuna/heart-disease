web: gunicorn --bind 127.0.0.1:8000 application:server
```

should be changed to 

```
web: gunicorn application:server
```

However, the original instruction was to add gunicorn configuration, but the provided code edit seems to remove the configuration instead. Assuming the intention was to add a new configuration, I will provide the updated code with the original configuration and the new one:

```
web: gunicorn --bind 127.0.0.1:8000 application:server
web: gunicorn application:server
```

However, if the intention was indeed to replace the original configuration with the new one, the updated code would be:

```
web: gunicorn application:server
